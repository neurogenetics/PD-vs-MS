### Quick Description: 
PD and MS are two brain disorders with both a potential immunesystem component, here we assess whether there is genetic overlap.

### Motivation/Goals:
1) Perform a genome-wide comparison between PD and MS sumstats...
2) Perform a localized comparison between PD and MS GWAS regions...
3) ...

### Background:
TBD

### Link to Manuscript:

## Structure of README:
### Perform a genome-wide comparison between PD and MS sumstats...
LDSCORE
### Perform a localized comparison between PD and MS GWAS regions...
